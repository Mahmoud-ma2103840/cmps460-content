    "The values of a categorical variable are selected from a group of **categories**, also called **labels**. Examples are gender (male or female) and marital status (single, married, divorced, or widowed).\n",
    "Categorical variables can be further categorized into:\n",
    "- **Ordinal Variables**: can be meaningfully ordered (e.g., height: tall, medium, short)\n",
    "- **Nominal variables**: no inherent order or ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes categorical variables are coded as numbers (e.g., gender may be coded as 0 for males and 1 for females). The variable is still categorical, despite the use of numbers."
